/**
 * Public entry point for the Blockchain Buddies CLI auth helpers.
 *
 * The main class is `ClerkCliAuth` — instantiate with config, then:
 *   - await auth.login() → opens browser, starts localhost callback, exchanges code, stores tokens
 *   - await auth.getAccessToken() → returns cached token, refreshes if expired
 *   - await auth.whoami() → calls /oauth/userinfo with cached token
 *   - await auth.logout() → clears stored tokens
 *
 * Implementation lives in ./clerk-cli-auth.ts and ./lib/*.
